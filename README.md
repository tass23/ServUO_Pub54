# [ServUO]
ServUO was a community-driven Ultima Online server emulator written in C#, but it is someone's pet project instead.

### Version
Publish 54 v1.0
Maintained by:
   Not a single soul anymore.

### Installation
Getting started with ServUO is not 100% user-friendly or intuitive, so hopefully it works.

#### Windows
1. Rename ServUO._xe to ServUO.exe.
2.Just run `Compile.WIN.bat` and follow the prompts. This script will compile both the server binary and Ultima SDK binary for you and run the server for you at end. After this you can run the server by executing `ServUO.exe`.

#### OSX
`brew install mono`  
`make`

#### Ubuntu
`apt-get install mono-complete`  
`make`
